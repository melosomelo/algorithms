# Algorithms

My implementations/explanations of different algorithms/data structures, for
pure learning purposes. I also use this repository in order to practice with any
new language that I might be learning at the time.

The implementations are separated into topics, which are reflected in the folder
structure of the project. Each topic will have a `README.md` that will provide
some explanation of the different algorithms/data structures that fall into that
specific topic. Topics may have subtopics.

## Topics

- [Linear data structures](./linear-data-structures/README.md) - Stacks, queues
  and linked lists.
- [Sorting algorithms](./sorting/README.md)
