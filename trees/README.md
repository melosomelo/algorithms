# Trees ðŸŒ³

A tree is an abstract data type that is widely used in computer science to
represent a collection of elements with a hierarchical relationship between
them. Each element of the tree is called a **node**, and each node (except the
root) has one parent, but can have many (or even zero) children, depending on
the type of the tree.

etc.), check their individual pages._
