# Sorting

To sort is to organize a collection of elements with regards to a specific
order. This order may very well be the standard numerical relation of
greater/smaller, but the use cases of these algorithms certainly aren't limited
to it.

There are many, many different sorting algorithms out there. Nevertheless, there
are certain questions we'd like answered about each one, so that we can compare
and see which is the best fit for our particular use case. Some of these
questions are:

- What is the time/memory complexity on the best/worst/average case scenario?
- Is it stable?
- Does it sort the collection in place?
- How does it perform with a small/large set of elements?
