# Searching ðŸ”Ž

Searching is a fundamental problem in computer science. Many are the occasions
in which we must search for a particular element within a larger collection, and
must do so efficiently.

|   Algorithm   | Implemented | Best case | Worst case | Obs |

| Binary search |     âœ…      |  `O(1)`   | `O(log n)` |  -  |
| Linear search |     âœ…      |  `O(1)`   |   `O(n)`   |  -  |
